title: "Fall Fest"
excerpt: " >A remarkable residence, whose remarkable residents are clearly committed to making fall festive for all friends, even those who don't use Anki. I'm interested to see how the change of seasons affects morale at Darwin's Ltd. Upstairs; however, given the gusto with which this group exposed the little-known, festive nature of fall, I'm not sure any residence is better equipped to keep spirits high as the temperatures descend and the days shorten."

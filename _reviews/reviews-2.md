title: "A Local Regular"
excerpt: ">I’ve been a regular, casual customer of Darwin’s Upstairs since it opened—popping in for a drink, a snack, or an eulogy. I’ve enjoyed their bread at social gatherings and around campfires. I’ve even had the pleasure of spending time with their Fall 2020 Fellowship recipient.

However, it was only tonight that I truly got the full Darwin’s experience through a sumptuous bowl of their signature dish: Siracha Pasta. Sourced by their merchandiser, Tyler, and bolstered by farm-fresh Misfit bounty, the steaming bowl of pasta that I enjoyed high above Putnam Ave was rich, satisfying, and garlic-forward. My breath is rank and my belly is full—thank you, Darwin’s Upstairs!"
